## Random number generation with Python

In the video, Jake showed you how to use Python to generate (pseudo) random number using `numpy`, a skill that will come in handy whenever thinking probabilistically! In the demo, Jake used `np.random.rand()`, which generates random numbers between 0 and 1 with equal probability. Another function we will find useful is `np.random.randn()`, which generates normally-distributed numbers.

*** =instructions
- Import `numpy` and `matplotlib.pylot`, using their common aliases.
- Seed the random number generator with the value 0.
- Generate 10,000 normally-distributed random numbers using `np.random.randn()`.
- Plot the histogram with 20 bins and display the plot, using `plt.hist()` and `plt.show()`, respectively.

## Rollin' dice with Python

Jake simulated coin tosses by generating uniformly-distributed numbers, and comparing them to the probability 0.5. Here you will simulate rolling of dice using the same technique. The question we'd like to answer is this: how likely are you to roll more than four sixes in five rolls of a standard six-sided die?

*** =instructions
- Seed the random number generator with a value of 0.
- The probability of rolling a 6 on a single roll is 1/6. Using `np.random.rand()`, simulate 10,000 trials of 5 rolls.
- Compute the number of sixes observed in each trial.
- Plot and show a histogram of the results, with 11 bins.

*** =pre_exercise_code

```

*** =sample_code
```{python}
# Seed your RNG
np.random.seed(0)

# Simulate 10,000 trials of 5 rolls each: sixes
sixes = (np.random.rand(10000, 5) < 1/6)

# Compute the number of sixes observed in each trial: total
total = sixes.sum(1)

# Plot and show the histrogram
plt.hist(total, 11);
plt.show()

```

*** =solution
```{python}
# Seed your RNG
np.random.seed(0)

# Simulate 10,000 trials of 5 rolls each: sixes
sixes = (np.random.rand(10000, 5) < 1/6)

# Compute the number of sixes observed in each trial: total
total = sixes.sum(1)

# Plot and show the histrogram
plt.hist(total, 11);
plt.show()

## How many times did you roll 3 or more sixes?

You have now simulated the number of sixes observed in 10,000 trials of 5 rolls.
The number of sixes observed in each trial, `total`, is in the namespace. Your job now is to answer the question:

**What is the approximate probability of rolling 3 or more sixes in five rolls?**

To answer this, count the number of times an entry in `total` is `>= 3` and divide by the length of `total`.

# Compute the number of sixes observed in each trial: total
total = sixes.sum(1)

```
