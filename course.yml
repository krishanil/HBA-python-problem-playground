title: Bayesian Thinking with Python
description: >-
  Bayesian Thinking and Inference are growing in popularity as methods for
  dealing with data and statistics, particularly in the task of modeling
  uncertainty in models that you build. In this course, we'll demistify Bayesian
  Thinking by providing a hands-on, Python-based practical approach using hacker
  statistics. You'll learn or re-learn about probability theory in this context,
  Bayes' Theorem and see how Bayesian Thinking can be effective when modeling
  real-world phenomena, such as the orbital parameters of planets! You'll also
  come out well-versed in the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist
  thinking and know when each approach is appropriate.
